            <h3>Hash Joins</h3>
            <p>When one of the join inputs is not sorted by the join variable,
                a hash join is performed rather than a merge join</p>
            <p>A hash join receives input out of order, and cannot utilize gap
                information.</p>
            <p>What can still be done is an approximation of the variable's domain</p>
