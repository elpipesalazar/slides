            <h3>The purpose of this talk is to present a method of speeding the
                processing of Join queries over RDF graphs in the scale of 1B+ triples</h3>
            <p>The goal is to be able to serve reasonable queries in interactive time</p>
            <p>We'll go over previous work in allowing queries to be processed in parallel</p>
