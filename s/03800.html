            <p>By viewing the hash map as a histogram, we can use the side effects of
                a hash join as a method to learn information about the variables'
                Domain</p>
            <p>If a bit is off in the hash vector, we know that the variable
                will never be bound to a value that the hash function maps to
                that bit</p>
