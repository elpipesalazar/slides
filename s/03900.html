            <p>A single hash join pass can generate such hash vectors for not
                just the join variable, but for all variables it sees</p>
            <p>The longer the program runs, the more hash joins are performed,
                the more precise Domain Filtering becomes</p>
            <p>The domain information, unlike gap information, can be also used
                to filter the input for hash joins</p>
