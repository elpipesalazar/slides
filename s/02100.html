            <p>Previous work showed that it is better to have one "giant triples table"</p>
            <p><ul>Pros:
              <li>Simplicity
              <li>Good memory locality
              <li>A lot of sequential access</ul>
              <ul>Cons:
              <li>All joins are self-joins</ul>
            </p>
            <p><strong>If we can make self joins over the huge table efficient, then the Pros outweigh the Cons</strong></p>
