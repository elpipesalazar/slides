            <p>SIP as proposed in the current work can be implemented in any RDF engine that provides:</p>
            <p><ul>
              <li>Indexes on all S/P/O ordering combinations, built by B+ trees containing the triples directly, with a separate dictionary mapping identifiers to literals
              <li>Merge joins are performed directly on the indexes, and pipelined
              <li>An optimal or near-optimal join order chooser
            </ul></p>
