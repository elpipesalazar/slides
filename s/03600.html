            <p>Merge Joins and Index Scans:</p>
            <p>These work on the B+ indexes. Checking if a triple should be skipped
                too often results in a major CPU overhead, and in a significant
                drop in L2 hit rate</p>
            <p>The system only checks for skips when a new page is about to be
                read into memory</p>
            <p>The CPU overhead is once per page, which is amortized to nearly zero</p>
            <p>The time saved by not reading whole pages is significant</p>
