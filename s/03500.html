            <p>Additionaly, throughout the execution of the query, information is
                kept about the possible Domain of each equivalence class</p>
            <p>For example, it might become apparent that X1, X2, X3 are in [1000-1500]
                and that Y1, Y2, Y3 are in [500-2000] or [3000-3500]</p>
            <p>All operators can use this information to filter out intermediary
                results that will never end up in the final result</p>
